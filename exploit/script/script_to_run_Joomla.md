<!-- Script to run and perform exploit -->
To update the package list and install JoomScan, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install joomscan
```

To scan a Joomla website using JoomScan, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
joomscan -u http://joomla.ba
```
Once the scan is complete, look for vulnerabilities from the generated results

We are also using SearchSploit for Remote Command Execution. First install SearchSploit if it is not already

To install Searchsploit, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb
```

Then perform this run in bash

```bash
searchsploit xcloner
```

Now we perform our exploit in Remote Command Execution and copy the results in 16246.py locally
```bash
searchsploit php/webapps/16246.py
```

Once the exploit is completed, we can copy the exploits in the .py file
```bash
searchsploit -m exploit/php/webapps/16246.py
```

Finally the exploit is copied in the .py, so lets run the cat function to read the exploits and vulnerabilities.
Go to the directory where the .py file is located and open it
```bash
cat 16246.py
```
